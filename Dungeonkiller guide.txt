In order to play this weird route, you must be on a route where killing enemies is enabled. Any actions
taken outside of that will not affect the run.

The steps:

1) Play the dungeon normally until you unlock the second floor. Be sure not to spare the basement Shadynn.

2) Immediately go to the Game Trial room and fail the trial. Dess will destroy the arcade machine.
   - It is important you complete the Game Trial first. Doing otherwise will abort the run.
   - This would be a good time to note, if "Something new" is a choicer option, select it. Selecting
     otherwise will abort the run.

3) Go through the Observation and Music trials as normal, but only getting the bare minimum score to pass.
   - It is important you save Trial by Combat for last. Doing otherwise will abort the run.

4) Kill all the enemies in Trial by Combat. If you're still on the route, Jamm will refuse to pick up the
key, making Dess do it herself.

5) Enter the final boss area and kill the final boss.

The effects:
   - The talk with Dess in the party room will change slightly, too.
   - You will have a new weapon called the Oblitersling, which will make killing enemies easier, but lower
     Jamm's defense harshly. You cannot sell or otherwise lose this weapon.
   - You will not obtain the flower bracelet.
   - Various texts for Jamm will be different. At some points, Jamm won't even care.
   - If you check Jamm's spells, he will no longer have HealSling.
   - Marcy's "Father" text will be different.
