An open source Kristal mod that anyone can contribute to

# Rouxls (Pronounced "Rules")
1: No NSFW, we gotta keep this mod at the very least PG-13.

2: If you're using assets that you didn't make, be sure to credit the original author(s)!

3: Don't just completely remove someone else's commit, although you can still edit what someone else has made.

4: I can't believe I have to add this rule, but NO ADDING A SCRIPT THAT JUST DOXXES YOU
